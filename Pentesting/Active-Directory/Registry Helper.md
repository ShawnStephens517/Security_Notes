#### Copying SAM Registry Hives

There are three registry hives that we can copy if we have local admin access on the target; each will have a specific purpose when we get to dumping and cracking the hashes. Here is a brief description of each in the table below:

|Registry Hive|Description|
|---|---|
|`hklm\sam`|Contains the hashes associated with local account passwords. We will need the hashes so we can crack them and get the user account passwords in cleartext.|
|`hklm\system`|Contains the system bootkey, which is used to encrypt the SAM database. We will need the bootkey to decrypt the SAM database.|
|`hklm\security`|Contains cached credentials for domain accounts. We may benefit from having this on a domain-joined Windows target.|

We can create backups of these hives using the `reg.exe` utility.

#### Using reg.exe save to Copy Registry Hives

Launching CMD as an admin will allow us to run reg.exe to save copies of the aforementioned registry hives. Run these commands below to do so:

Attacking SAM
