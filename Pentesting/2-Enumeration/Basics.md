## Domain Info
Gather information about target domain structure using open tools.

- crt.sh `curl -s https://crt.sh/\?q\=inlanefreight.com\&output\=json | jq .`
- Look for org hosted servers (ensuring we don't hit a 3rd party host) `for i in $(cat subdomainlist);do host $i | grep "has address" | grep twinkletoes.com | cut -d" " -f1,4;done`
- DIG `dig any twinkletoes.com`
