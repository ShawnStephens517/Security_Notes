The query results provide three columns for the staff_users table: id, password, and username. We can use the username and password columns for our following query to retrieve the user's information.
```sql
0 UNION SELECT 1,2,group_concat(username,':',password SEPARATOR '<br>') FROM staff_users
```


Again, we use the group_concat method to return all of the rows into one string and make it easier to read. We've also added **,':',** to split the username and password from each other. Instead of being separated by a comma, we've chosen the HTML **<br>** tag that forces each result to be on a separate line to make for easier reading.
