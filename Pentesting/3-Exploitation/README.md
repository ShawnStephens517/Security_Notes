## Web-Based Exploitation

This section focuses on techniques and tools used for exploiting web applications. Topics include:

- **SQL Injection (SQLi)**: Techniques for identifying and exploiting SQL vulnerabilities.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Methods for injecting malicious scripts into web pages.
- **File Inclusion Attacks**: Exploiting Local and Remote File Inclusion vulnerabilities.
- **Authentication Bypass**: Techniques to bypass login mechanisms.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**: Exploiting server-side vulnerabilities to access internal resources.
- **Web Shells**: Uploading and using web shells for post-exploitation.

## Network/Infrastructure Exploitation

This section covers techniques for exploiting network and infrastructure vulnerabilities. Topics include:

- **Privilege Escalation**: Methods for escalating privileges on compromised systems.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks**: Techniques for intercepting and manipulating network traffic.
- **Exploitation Frameworks**: Using tools like Metasploit for automated exploitation.
- **Buffer Overflows**: Identifying and exploiting memory vulnerabilities.
- **Password Cracking**: Techniques for cracking or bypassing password protections.
- **Pivoting**: Moving laterally within a network after initial compromise.

## Resources

- **Tools**: A list of commonly used tools for exploitation (e.g., Burp Suite, Metasploit, Nmap).
- **References**: Links to documentation, tutorials, and cheat sheets.
- **Practice Labs**: Recommended platforms for practicing exploitation techniques (e.g., Hack The Box, TryHackMe).
