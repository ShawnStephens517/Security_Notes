SGML - Standard Generalized Markup Language

XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) is a language used to transform and format XML documents. While XSLT is primarily used for data transformation and formatting, it is also significantly relevant to XXE (XMLExternal Entities) attacks.

XSLT can be used to facilitate XXE attacks in several ways:

1. Data Extraction: XSLT can be used to extract sensitive data from an XML document, which can then be used in an XXE attack. For example, an XSLT stylesheet can extract user credentials or other sensitive information from an XML file.
2. Entity Expansion: XSLT can expand entities defined in an XML document, including external entities. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious entities, leading to an XXE vulnerability.
3. Data Manipulation: XSLT can manipulate data in an XML document, potentially allowing an attacker to inject malicious data or modify existing data to exploit an XXE vulnerability.
4. Blind XXE: XSLT can be used to perform blind XXE attacks, in which an attacker injects malicious entities without seeing the server's response.

DTD - Document Type Definitions

**DTDs play a crucial role in XXE injection, as they can be used to declare external entities**

### In-Band vs Out-of-Band XXE

In-band XXE refers to an XXE vulnerability where the attacker can see the response from the server. This allows for straightforward data exfiltration and exploitation. The attacker can simply send a malicious XML payload to the application, and the server will respond with the extracted data or the result of the attack.

Out-of-band XXE, on the other hand, refers to an XXE vulnerability where the attacker cannot see the response from the server. This requires using alternative channels, such as DNS or HTTP requests, to exfiltrate data. To extract the data, the attacker must craft a malicious XML payload that will trigger an out-of-band request, such as a DNS query or an HTTP request.
